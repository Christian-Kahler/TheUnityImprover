# Unified Dynamics (GPU based)
(Still WIP, currently no access)<br/>
```
Unified Dynamics is built on my Cloth Dynamics Asset and will support all kinds of physics collisions,
similar to NVIDIA's FleX, but with the advantage to run on all popular devices.
It also supports better character interaction with the environment.

# Custom Asset Importer
(Still WIP, currently no access)<br/>
```
This tool will help you to decide, how and which assets are getting imported in your Unity project.
This will improve the import time, because you don't have to reimport the assets, 
if they normally were not imported correctly by the Unity Editor.
(Will be included into Nano Tech!)
