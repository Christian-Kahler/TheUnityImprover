# Distance Field Shadows + AO
(Still WIP, currently no access)<br/>
```
SDF ray traced rendering for shadows and ambient occlusion.

# Custom Asset Importer
(Still WIP, currently no access)<br/>
```
This tool will help you to decide, how and which assets are getting imported in your Unity project.
This will improve the importing time, because you don't have to reimport the assets, 
if they normally were not imported correctly by the Unity Editor.
